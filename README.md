# AVQACL: A Novel Benchmark for Audio-Visual Question Answering Continual Learning（CVPR2025）

In this paper, a novel benchmark for audio-visual question answering continual learning (AVQACL) is introduced, aiming to study fine-grained scene understanding
and spatial-temporal reasoning in videos under a continual learning setting. 

## Environment

Python 3.12.4

Pytorch 2.4.0

To setup the environment, please run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

### Split-AVQA and Split-MUSIC-AVQA


The feature data extracted by the audio and visual encoders can be downloaded 
from the google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNEG-tF_UUugz-dFD28mZr_Qh5x3ucpo/view?usp=sharing). After downloading, place the 'features' folder in the current directory 
to run experiments with our proposed method.
